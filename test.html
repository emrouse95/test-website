                Welcome to our book club! We are a small group of women who meet up once a month to discuss the book we chose for the previous month as well as choose our next book. We are open to a wide variety of genres including but not limited to: Fantasy, Crime, Drama, Thriller, etc. We all love to read but most importantly, we love being able to support each other!

                        <li>Q. How do you pick the books?
                            <p class="answer">A. We each submit a book that we think the group would like and then we randomly draw from thos options.</p>
                            Q. What days of the week do you meet?
                            <p class="answer">A. Typically we meet on the weekend since that is when everyone has a free day to get together.</p>
                            Q. What happens if I fall behind or don't read the chosen books?
                            <p class="answer">A. We understand life happens! Please, do not feel like you are excluded from any get-togethers for not reading the book. Whether you read it all, read part of it, or simply don't finish a book, we welcome you to still join any and all meetings you woud like!</p>
